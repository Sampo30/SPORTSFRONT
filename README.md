# SPORTSFRONT
Front-end for SPORTSAPI
This is the react front end to the back end Sports API
It has the routes on the left that open them on the right and they work with the back-end and the database.
It does not look nice but works. Some of the sunctionality is not very user friendly and with more time it could be made a lot better.
