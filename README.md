# SPORTSFRONT
Front-end for SPORTSAPI
This is the react front end to the back end Sports API
It has the routes on the left that open them on the right and they work with the back-end and the database.
I tried to deploy it with render, but I think that my code is only working in localhost. I run out of time to work that out.
I think I should have used the deployd back-end all the time. But I made the mistake of combining the porjects and then I dont know how to deploy them together.
